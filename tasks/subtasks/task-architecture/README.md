# ECS-Optimized Component-Based Task Architecture

This feature implements a high-performance, component-based task system that replaces the current object-oriented task approach with an ECS-optimized batch processing architecture.

## Overview

The new architecture treats tasks as data components that systems process in batches for maximum performance. Movement becomes a primitive component that other task components depend on, perfect for ECS architectures with hundreds of entities.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Task Component Architecture (Subtasks 01-04)
Foundation components and interfaces for the new task system.

### Phase 2: Task Processing Systems (Subtasks 05-08)
Core processing systems that handle task execution and coordination.

### Phase 3: Integration and Migration (Subtasks 09-12)
Migration from existing system and performance optimizations.

## Dependencies

- EntityManager for component management
- Existing Position and PathFinder systems
- Logger for error handling
- Component type enums

## Testing Strategy

Each subtask includes unit tests focusing on:
- Component creation and initialization
- System processing logic
- Performance benchmarks for batch operations
- Integration with existing systems

## Performance Goals

- 10x improvement in task processing throughput
- Memory-efficient component pooling
- Sub-millisecond batch processing for 100+ entities
- Spatial indexing for O(log n) proximity queries
