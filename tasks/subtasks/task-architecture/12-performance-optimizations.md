# 12 - Performance Optimizations

## Objective
Implement advanced performance optimizations including spatial indexing, batch processing improvements, and memory optimization techniques to achieve the target 10x performance improvement over the legacy system.

## Scope
- Implement spatial indexing for proximity queries
- Add advanced batch processing optimizations
- Implement memory usage optimizations
- Add performance monitoring and profiling tools
- Benchmark and validate performance improvements

## Implementation Details

### Spatial Indexing System
```lua
-- game/systems/SpatialIndex.lua
SpatialIndex = {
  gridSize = 8,                 -- Grid cell size in tiles
  grid = {},                    -- 2D grid of entity lists
  entityPositions = {}          -- Cache of entity positions
}

function SpatialIndex:getNearbyEntities(position, radius)
  -- Return entities within radius using grid lookup
  -- O(1) average case vs O(n) linear search
end
```

### Batch Processing Optimizations
```lua
-- Optimized batch processing with data locality
function MovementSystem:processOptimizedBatch(entities, dt)
  -- Sort entities by spatial location for cache efficiency
  table.sort(entities, function(a, b)
    local posA = EntityManager:getComponent(a, ComponentType.POSITION)
    local posB = EntityManager:getComponent(b, ComponentType.POSITION)
    return posA.x < posB.x or (posA.x == posB.x and posA.y < posB.y)
  end)
  
  -- Batch process with improved memory access patterns
  for i = 1, #entities, BATCH_SIZE do
    local batchEnd = math.min(i + BATCH_SIZE - 1, #entities)
    self:processBatch(entities, i, batchEnd, dt)
  end
end
```

### Memory Optimizations
- Implement struct-of-arrays pattern for hot data
- Add memory pool recycling for frequently allocated objects
- Optimize component data layout for cache efficiency

### Performance Monitoring
```lua
-- game/systems/PerformanceMonitor.lua
PerformanceMonitor = {
  taskMetrics = {},             -- Per-task-type performance data
  frameTimeHistory = {},        -- Rolling frame time window
  memoryUsage = {}              -- Memory allocation tracking
}
```

### Benchmarking Framework
- Create performance test scenarios with 100+, 500+, 1000+ entities
- Measure task throughput (tasks completed per second)
- Track memory allocation rates
- Compare against legacy system performance

## Files to Create
- `game/systems/SpatialIndex.lua` - Spatial indexing implementation
- `game/systems/PerformanceMonitor.lua` - Performance tracking
- `testing/benchmarks/task_performance.lua` - Performance benchmarks

## Files to Modify
- `game/systems/TaskExecutionSystem.lua` - Add spatial indexing integration
- `game/systems/MovementSystem.lua` - Add batch processing optimizations
- All task processors - Add performance monitoring

## Tests
Create test files:
- `testing/__tests__/spatial_index.lua` - Test spatial indexing correctness
- `testing/__tests__/performance_monitor.lua` - Test metrics collection
- `testing/benchmarks/performance_comparison.lua` - Legacy vs new system

Benchmark scenarios:
- 100 entities with mixed tasks
- 500 entities with movement-heavy workload
- 1000 entities with mining tasks
- Memory allocation stress test

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Spatial indexing provides O(log n) proximity queries
- [ ] Batch processing shows measurable cache efficiency gains
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized with minimal allocations
- [ ] Performance monitoring provides actionable metrics
- [ ] 10x performance improvement achieved over legacy system
- [ ] All benchmarks pass performance targets
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines

## Dependencies
- All previous subtasks (01-11)
- Performance testing framework
- Memory profiling tools

## Estimated Time
60 minutes

## Notes
This is the culmination of the performance-focused architecture. Focus on measurable improvements and data-driven optimization. The 10x performance target should be achievable through the combination of batch processing, spatial indexing, and memory optimizations implemented throughout the architecture.
