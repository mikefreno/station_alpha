  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Test comprehensive flex layout functionality combining all properties

deliverables:
- Integration tests for complete flex layout combinations
- Tests for complex layouts with multiple flex properties
- Verify proper behavior when all flex properties are used together

steps:
- Create test suite for comprehensive flex layout tests
- Test elements with various combinations of flex properties
- Verify that all properties work together correctly
- Test complex layouts with nested flex elements
- Validate proper positioning and spacing in complex scenarios

tests:
- Integration: Test Element.new() with multiple flex properties combined
- Integration: Test layoutChildren() method with comprehensive flex settings
- Integration: Test nested flex elements with various combinations of properties
- Integration: Verify that all flex properties work together without conflicts

acceptance_criteria:
- Elements can be created with multiple flex properties simultaneously
- All flex properties work correctly together in complex layouts
- Nested flex elements behave properly with combined properties
- Proper positioning and spacing maintained in complex scenarios
- No conflicts or unexpected behavior when combining flex properties

validation:
- Run existing tests in testing/__tests__/gui-layout-testing.lua if it exists, or create new test file for this functionality
- Execute: lua testing/__tests__/gui-layout-testing.lua

notes:
- This task should be done after all individual flex property tests are completed
- Should test combinations of flexDirection, justifyContent, alignItems, and flexWrap
- Nested flex elements should be tested to ensure proper behavior
- Complex layouts with multiple flex properties should be validated
