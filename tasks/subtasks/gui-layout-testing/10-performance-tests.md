  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Test performance of flex layout system and optimization

deliverables:
- Performance benchmarking tests
- Tests for layout calculation efficiency
- Verify that layout system scales well with complexity

steps:
- Create test suite for performance tests
- Benchmark layout calculation times
- Test scalability with increasing number of children
- Measure memory usage during layout operations
- Validate performance improvements over time

tests:
- Unit: Performance benchmarking of layout calculations
- Unit: Test scalability with large numbers of children
- Unit: Memory usage monitoring during layout operations
- Integration: End-to-end performance testing for various layouts
- Integration: Stress testing with complex nested layouts

acceptance_criteria:
- Layout calculations perform efficiently within acceptable time limits
- System scales well with increasing number of children
- Memory usage remains reasonable during layout operations
- Complex nested layouts perform adequately
- Performance improvements are measurable and consistent

validation:
- Run existing tests in testing/__tests__/gui-layout-testing.lua if it exists, or create new test file for this functionality
- Execute: lua testing/__tests__/gui-layout-testing.lua

notes:
- This task should be done after all functional tests are completed
- Should measure actual performance metrics and validate improvements
- Performance testing is important for UI responsiveness
- Stress testing with complex layouts should be included
