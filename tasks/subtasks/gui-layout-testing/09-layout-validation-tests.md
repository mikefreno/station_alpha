  depends_on: [01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08]
  tags: [implementation, tests-required]

objective:
- Test layout validation and error handling in flex system

deliverables:
- Unit tests for layout validation logic
- Tests for invalid property combinations
- Verify proper error handling and graceful degradation

steps:
- Create test suite for layout validation tests
- Test elements with invalid property combinations
- Verify that validation logic catches errors
- Test graceful degradation when invalid properties are used
- Validate that system doesn't crash with malformed layouts

tests:
- Unit: Test Element.new() with invalid flex property combinations
- Unit: Test layoutChildren() method with invalid inputs
- Integration: Test error handling in various layout scenarios
- Integration: Verify graceful degradation for malformed layouts

acceptance_criteria:
- Invalid property combinations are properly detected and handled
- System doesn't crash when encountering malformed layouts
- Error messages provide useful debugging information
- Graceful degradation works for invalid layouts
- All edge cases are covered by validation logic

validation:
- Run existing tests in testing/__tests__/gui-layout-testing.lua if it exists, or create new test file for this functionality
- Execute: lua testing/__tests__/gui-layout-testing.lua

notes:
- This task should be done after all flex property tests are completed
- Should test edge cases and invalid inputs to ensure robustness
- Error handling and validation logic should be thoroughly tested
- System should gracefully handle malformed layouts without crashing
