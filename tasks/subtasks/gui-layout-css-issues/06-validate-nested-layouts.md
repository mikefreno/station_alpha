  id: gui-layout-css-issues-06
  feature: gui-layout-css-issues
  priority: P2
  depends_on: [gui-layout-css-issues-05]
  tags: [implementation, layout, validation]

objective:
- Ensure nested layouts work correctly with proper dimension and position handling
- Validate depth calculations for complex nested structures
- Test that all layout properties propagate correctly through nesting

deliverables:
- Validated nested layout functionality in FlexLove library
- Proper handling of nested flex containers with different configurations
- Dimension and position calculations maintain accuracy at all nesting levels
- Complex hierarchical layouts work correctly

steps:
- Examine depth-layout-tests.lua to understand nested layout requirements
- Test complex nested structures with various combinations
- Validate dimension propagation through parent-child relationships  
- Ensure positioning remains accurate across multiple nesting levels
- Test edge cases like deeply nested flex containers

tests:
- Unit: Run depth-layout-tests.lua to verify nested layouts work
- Integration: Test complex hierarchical structures 
- Integration: Test various nesting combinations and configurations
- E2E: Full validation of nested layout scenarios with mixed properties

acceptance_criteria:
- Nested flex layouts maintain proper dimensions and positions
- Complex hierarchical structures work correctly  
- All nesting levels properly calculate and apply layout properties
- No regressions introduced by previous fixes
- All depth layout tests pass without errors

validation:
- Run depth-layout-tests.lua after implementing fixes
- Test various nesting scenarios with different configurations
- Validate that complex nested layouts behave as expected
- Check for any dimension or position calculation issues at deeper levels

notes:
- The issue may involve how dimensions are calculated in nested elements
- Need to ensure recursive layout calculations work correctly 
- Positioning in nested containers should be relative to their parent
