meta:
  id: gui-layout-css-issues-07
  feature: gui-layout-css-issues
  priority: P2
  depends_on: [gui-layout-css-issues-06]
  tags: [testing, validation, final]

objective:
- Create comprehensive tests to validate all fixes work correctly
- Ensure all GUI test suites pass with the implemented fixes
- Document the resolved issues and verify no regressions

deliverables:
- Complete test suite validation for fixed implementation
- All original failing tests now pass
- Regression testing to ensure no new issues introduced
- Documentation of fixes applied and their effectiveness

steps:
- Run all original GUI test files to confirm they pass
- Create additional edge case tests for the fixed functionality
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality 
- Document the specific changes made to fix each issue
- Test complex scenarios that combine multiple fixed areas

tests:
- Unit: Run all original test files (justify-content, flex-direction, absolute-positioning, depth-layout)
- Integration: Test combined scenarios with mixed properties
- E2E: Complete end-to-end validation of full layout system
- Regression: Verify no existing functionality was broken

acceptance_criteria:
- All original GUI tests pass without errors
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Complex layouts with multiple fixed areas work correctly
- Implementation fully resolves all identified issues
- Comprehensive validation confirms fixes are complete

validation:
- Run all test files from game/libs/testing directory
- Compare results before and after fixes
- Verify each task's specific fix works as intended
- Confirm no new errors or unexpected behavior

notes:
- This is the final validation step to ensure all fixes are working
- Need to run comprehensive tests on all originally failing scenarios
- Should include both basic and edge case testing
