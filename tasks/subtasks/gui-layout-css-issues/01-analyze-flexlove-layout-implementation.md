  tags: [analysis, implementation, layout]

objective:
- Identify root causes of CSS layout test failures in FlexLove library
- Determine where child element dimensions are not properly initialized
- Locate issues with justify-content and flex-direction calculations

deliverables:
- Analysis report documenting layout implementation flaws
- Root cause identification for nil value errors in tests
- Clear understanding of how layoutChildren function should work

steps:
- Examine the FlexLove.lua source code for layoutChildren implementation
- Run individual GUI tests to identify specific failure points
- Analyze test assumptions vs actual behavior 
- Document missing element properties that cause nil access errors
- Identify inconsistencies in flex direction handling logic

tests:
- Unit: Run justify-content-tests.lua to observe failures
- Unit: Run flex-direction-tests.lua to observe failures  
- Unit: Run absolute-positioning.lua to observe failures
- Integration: Examine how child elements get their width/height properties set during creation

acceptance_criteria:
- Clear identification of where child elements lose dimension information (width/height)
- Documented understanding of why layoutChildren fails with nil values
- Analysis shows the core issue is in element initialization vs layout calculation
- Root cause clearly stated for all failing test scenarios

validation:
- Run each test file individually to confirm failures
- Examine FlexLove.lua layoutChildren function line-by-line
- Compare test expectations with actual element properties during execution

notes:
- Tests are failing because child elements don't have proper width/height set
- The issue likely occurs in Element.new() or when addChild() is called
- Layout calculations assume children have width/height fields but they're nil
