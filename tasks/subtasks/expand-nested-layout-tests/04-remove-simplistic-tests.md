meta:
  id: expand-nested-layout-tests-04
  feature: expand-nested-layout-tests
  priority: P2
  depends_on: [expand-nested-layout-tests-03]
  tags: [testing, cleanup]

objective:
- Remove redundant and overly simplistic tests while preserving essential test coverage

deliverables:
- Updated testing directory with only complex and meaningful tests
- Documentation of removed tests and their coverage migration

steps:
- Review and identify simplistic tests in:
  - absolute-positioning.lua
  - align-items-tests.lua
  - align-self-tests.lua
  - flex-container-tests.lua
  - flex-direction-tests.lua
  - justify-content-tests.lua
  - nested-layout-tests.lua
- Document test coverage provided by new complex tests
- Remove identified simplistic tests
- Update any dependent test references
- Verify no coverage gaps were created

tests:
- Unit:
  - Verify all removed test functionality is covered in new tests
  - Check for broken test dependencies
- Integration:
  - Full test suite execution
  - Coverage report analysis

acceptance_criteria:
- All simplistic tests are removed
- No regression in test coverage
- All remaining tests pass successfully
- Documentation updated to reflect changes
- No broken test dependencies

validation:
- Run full test suite
- Generate and review coverage report
- Verify no functionality gaps
- Check for broken references

notes:
- Keep baseline tests that serve as documentation
- Document rationale for each removed test
- Ensure migration path for all removed test coverage
