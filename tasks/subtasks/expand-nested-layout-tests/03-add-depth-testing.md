  feature: expand-nested-layout-tests
  priority: P2
  depends_on: [expand-nested-layout-tests-02]
  tags: [testing, layout, depth]

objective:
- Implement comprehensive depth testing for deeply nested FlexLove layouts

deliverables:
- New test file: game/libs/testing/depth-layout-tests.lua
- Test cases validating deep nesting behavior

steps:
- Create new test file depth-layout-tests.lua
- Implement test cases for:
  - Maximum supported nesting depth (5+ levels)
  - Property inheritance through deep nesting
  - Size calculation accuracy at depth
  - Performance benchmarks for deep structures
  - Edge cases in deep layouts
- Add depth-specific validation helpers
- Document depth-related limitations and best practices

tests:
- Unit:
  - Test creation of deep structures
  - Verify property inheritance
  - Validate size calculations at each level
  - Test performance impact
- Integration:
  - Full depth layout rendering
  - Cross-depth interaction tests

acceptance_criteria:
- All depth test cases pass successfully
- Tests validate structures up to 5 levels deep
- Property inheritance works correctly at all levels
- Performance remains acceptable at maximum depth
- Edge cases are properly handled

validation:
- Run: lua testing/__tests__/depth-layout-tests.lua
- Verify all tests pass
- Check performance metrics
- Validate property inheritance

notes:
- Monitor memory usage in deep structures
- Document any performance degradation patterns
- Consider implementing depth limits if needed
