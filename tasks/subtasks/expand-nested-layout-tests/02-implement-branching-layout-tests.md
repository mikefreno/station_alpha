  feature: expand-nested-layout-tests
  priority: P2
  depends_on: [expand-nested-layout-tests-01]
  tags: [testing, layout, branching]

objective:
- Create test cases for complex branching layouts with multiple child hierarchies

deliverables:
- New test file: game/libs/testing/branching-layout-tests.lua
- Test cases covering various branching scenarios

steps:
- Create new test file branching-layout-tests.lua
- Implement test cases for:
  - Multiple children at same level with different properties
  - Asymmetric branching structures
  - Dynamic child addition/removal
  - Mixed flex-direction in branches
  - Cross-branch alignment coordination
- Add validation for proper branch rendering
- Document branching patterns and expected behaviors

tests:
- Unit:
  - Test branch creation and structure
  - Verify child positioning in branches
  - Validate branch-specific properties
  - Test dynamic branch modifications
- Integration:
  - Full branching layout validation
  - Cross-branch interaction tests

acceptance_criteria:
- All branching test cases pass successfully
- Tests cover asymmetric layouts with 3+ branches
- Each branch can maintain independent properties
- Dynamic modifications preserve layout integrity
- Branch alignment works across different depths

validation:
- Run: lua testing/__tests__/branching-layout-tests.lua
- Verify all tests pass
- Check branch structure integrity
- Validate cross-branch alignments

notes:
- Consider performance impact of wide branching structures
- Reference existing FlexLove implementations for guidance
- Document any limitations discovered during testing
