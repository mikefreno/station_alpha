# Expand Nested Layout Tests

Objective: Enhance the testing suite for FlexLove library with complex nested layouts and branching scenarios

Status legend: [ ] todo, [~] in-progress, [x] done

Tasks
- [x] 01 — Create Complex Nested Layout Test Cases → `01-create-complex-nested-layout-test.md`
- [ ] 02 — Implement Branching Layout Tests → `02-implement-branching-layout-tests.md`
- [ ] 03 — Add Depth Testing for Nested Structures → `03-add-depth-testing.md`
- [ ] 04 — Remove Highly Simplistic Tests → `04-remove-simplistic-tests.md`

Dependencies
- 02 depends on 01
- 03 depends on 02
- 04 depends on 03

Exit criteria
- All existing simplistic tests are removed from the testing directory
- New complex nested layout test cases are implemented and passing
- Branching layout tests cover various branching scenarios
- Depth testing validates nested structures up to 5 levels deep
