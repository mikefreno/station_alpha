# Subtask 06: Migration Testing and Validation

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy to validate the ECS migration maintains all existing functionality while delivering performance improvements and new capabilities.

## Testing Scope

### 1. Functional Regression Testing
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Verify all existing task workflows work unchanged
- **ECS Functionality**: Validate new ECS components perform equivalently 
- **Hybrid Operation**: Test smooth operation during mixed legacy/ECS states
- **State Transitions**: Ensure clean switching between operational modes

### 2. Performance Validation
- **Throughput Testing**: Compare task processing rates between legacy/ECS
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor component pooling effectiveness
- **Latency Analysis**: Measure task response times and system overhead
- **Scalability Testing**: Validate performance under high entity counts

### 3. Integration Testing
- **System Coordination**: Test TaskExecutionSystem + MovementSystem + Processors
- **Dependency Resolution**: Validate complex task dependency chains work correctly
- **Cross-System Communication**: Ensure proper event handling and state synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Test graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Testing (Current State)
- Run full existing test suite to establish baseline
- Document any existing test failures as known issues
- Benchmark current performance metrics for comparison

### Phase 2: ECS Component Testing  
- Validate all ECS components work in isolation
- Test component pooling and lifecycle management
- Verify TaskAdapter conversion accuracy

### Phase 3: System Integration Testing
- Test TaskExecutionSystem with various component types
- Validate dependency resolution in complex scenarios
- Ensure proper coordination between movement and action systems

### Phase 4: Migration Testing
- Test incremental migration from legacy to ECS
- Validate TaskManager mode switching functionality
- Ensure data integrity during transitions

### Phase 5: Performance Validation
- Compare ECS vs legacy performance across multiple scenarios
- Test scalability with increasing entity counts
- Validate memory usage improvements

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All existing unit tests pass without modification
- [ ] No regression in task completion accuracy
- [ ] All legacy task types work through ECS adapter
- [ ] Mode switching works without game interruption
- [ ] Save/load compatibility maintained

### Performance Requirements  
- [ ] ECS mode matches or exceeds legacy performance
- [ ] Memory usage reduced by 15% through component pooling
- [ ] Task processing latency improved by 10%
- [ ] System scales to 10x current entity count limits

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Test coverage >= 90% for all new ECS code
- [ ] No critical bugs discovered during testing
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented

## Testing Tools and Infrastructure

### Test Execution
- Use existing `lua testing/__tests__/<test_file>.lua` pattern
- Leverage `testing/luaunit.lua` testing framework
- Utilize `testing/loveStub.lua` for love2d mocking

### Performance Measurement
- CPU profiling with Lua profiler
- Memory tracking through collectgarbage()
- Frame rate monitoring during stress tests
- Component pool utilization metrics

### Automation
- Script to run all tests in sequence: `lua testing/runAll.lua`
- Performance baseline capture and comparison scripts
- Automated regression detection for key metrics

## Risk Mitigation

### Test Data Management
- Isolated test environments to prevent cross-contamination
- Deterministic test scenarios for consistent results
- Proper cleanup between test runs

### Performance Testing Challenges
- Ensure tests run on representative hardware
- Account for JIT compilation warmup in benchmarks  
- Use multiple test runs to establish statistical significance

### Integration Complexity
- Start with simple scenarios and build complexity gradually
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate
- Maintain clear separation between unit and integration tests

## Dependencies
- Requires: Subtasks 01-05 (full integration implementation complete)
- Enables: Subtask 08 (performance optimization based on test results)

## Estimated Effort
**High** - Comprehensive testing requiring significant test development and execution time
