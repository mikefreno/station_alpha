# Subtask 08: Performance Optimizations and Cleanup

## Overview
Final optimization phase to maximize performance benefits of the ECS architecture, clean up legacy code, and ensure the system operates at peak efficiency.

## Performance Optimization Areas

### 1. Component Pool Optimizations
**Current State:** Basic component pooling implemented
**Optimization Targets:**
- Memory allocation reduction through larger pool sizes
- Cache-friendly data structures for better CPU performance
- Batch operations for component lifecycle management

**Specific Improvements:**
```lua
-- Pool Size Tuning
TaskComponentPool.defaultPoolSize = 1000  -- Increased from default
TaskComponentPool.expansionFactor = 1.5   -- Optimized growth rate

-- Memory Layout Optimization
-- Group components by type for better cache locality
-- Minimize pointer chasing in component access
```

### 2. System Update Loop Optimizations
**Current Bottlenecks:**
- Individual entity processing in TaskExecutionSystem
- Redundant component lookups across systems
- Lack of early exit optimizations

**Optimization Strategies:**
```lua
-- Batch Processing
function TaskExecutionSystem:update(dt)
    -- Early exit if no components to process
    if TaskComponentPool:isEmpty() then return end
    
    -- Batch process components by type
    self:processBatch(ComponentType.MOVEMENT, dt)
    self:processBatch(ComponentType.MINING, dt)
    self:processBatch(ComponentType.CONSTRUCTION, dt)
end

-- Vectorized Operations
-- Process multiple entities simultaneously where possible
```

### 3. Dependency Resolution Optimizations
**Current Implementation:** Individual dependency checks per component
**Optimized Approach:**
- Dependency graph caching for repeated lookups
- Batch dependency resolution for related components
- Lazy evaluation of complex dependency chains

### 4. Memory Management
**Garbage Collection Optimization:**
- Minimize object creation during gameplay loops
- Reuse temporary objects through pooling
- Optimize string concatenation and table operations

**Memory Layout:**
- Struct-of-Arrays data layout for component storage
- Minimize memory fragmentation through predictable allocation patterns

## Code Cleanup Tasks

### 1. Legacy Code Removal
**Files to Clean:**
- Remove unused legacy Task.lua methods and properties
- Clean up TaskQueue legacy compatibility code
- Remove deprecated TaskManager legacy mode switches

**Cleanup Checklist:**
- [ ] Remove legacy Task.perform() method implementations
- [ ] Clean up TaskQueue legacy task storage
- [ ] Remove TaskManager legacy mode toggle code
- [ ] Remove unused legacy imports across codebase

### 2. Code Deduplication
**Identified Duplications:**
- Similar error handling patterns across processors
- Repeated component validation logic
- Common entity position/state queries

**Refactoring Targets:**
```lua
-- Extract common patterns to utility functions
local TaskUtils = {
    validateComponent = function(component, entityId) end,
    getEntityPosition = function(entityId) end,
    handleTaskError = function(error, context) end
}
```

### 3. Documentation and Comments
**Documentation Updates:**
- Update API documentation for ECS components and systems
- Add performance tuning guides
- Document migration patterns for future reference

**Code Comments:**
- Add performance-critical section comments
- Document complex algorithms and optimization rationales
- Remove outdated comments referencing legacy systems

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Profiling Integration
**Metrics to Track:**
- Component processing time per frame
- Memory usage patterns and GC pressure
- System update frequency and timing
- Pool efficiency (hit/miss ratios)

**Profiling Code:**
```lua
local ProfileStats = {
    startTime = 0,
    componentProcessingTime = {},
    memoryUsage = {},
    poolStats = {}
}

function ProfileStats:startFrame()
    self.startTime = love.timer.getTime()
    collectgarbage("count") -- Track memory before frame
end

function ProfileStats:endFrame()
    local frameTime = love.timer.getTime() - self.startTime
    -- Log performance metrics
end
```

### 2. Performance Benchmarks
**Benchmark Scenarios:**
- High entity count stress tests (1000+ entities)
- Complex task dependency scenarios
- Memory allocation pressure tests
- Frame rate stability under load

**Target Metrics:**
- 60 FPS with 500+ active entities
- < 10ms per frame for task processing
- < 5MB memory growth over 10 minutes
- 90%+ component pool hit rate

## Final Integration

### 1. Configuration Optimization
**Runtime Configuration:**
```lua
-- Performance tuning configuration
local TaskSystemConfig = {
    poolSizes = {
        movement = 500,
        mining = 200,
        construction = 150,
        cleaning = 100
    },
    batchSizes = {
        componentProcessing = 50,
        dependencyResolution = 25
    },
    enableProfiling = false, -- Production setting
    enableLegacySupport = false -- Disable after migration
}
```

### 2. System Integration Validation
**Final Tests:**
- End-to-end performance validation
- Memory leak detection over extended play sessions
- Stress testing with maximum expected load
- Regression testing against baseline performance
