# Phase 3: Integration and Migration - ECS Task Architecture

This phase focuses on integrating the new ECS-based task architecture with the existing legacy systems and migrating from the old task management approach to the new one.

## Overview

The integration process requires careful coordination between the existing legacy systems and the new ECS components to ensure a smooth transition without breaking existing functionality.

### Current Legacy Systems
- **TaskManager.lua**: Basic task management with openTasks table and entity iteration
- **TaskQueue.lua**: Per-entity task queues with current task execution  
- **Task.lua**: Legacy task class with hardcoded task execution logic
- **main.lua**: Game loop calling TaskManager:update(dt) at line 69

### New ECS Systems (Already Implemented)
- **TaskExecutionSystem**: Central coordinator for all task processing
- **TaskDependencyResolver**: Automatic movement injection for action tasks
- **TaskComponentPool**: Efficient component object pooling  
- **MovementSystem**: Batch movement processing with pathfinding
- **Task Processors**: Mining/Construction/Cleaning specialized processors

## Subtasks

### 01. TaskManager ECS Bridge (01-taskmanager-ecs-bridge.md)
- Create compatibility layer between legacy TaskManager and new ECS systems
- Implement dual-mode operation for gradual migration
- Add ECS task creation methods to TaskManager

### 02. Legacy Task to ECS Component Adapter (02-legacy-task-adapter.md)  
- Build adapter to convert legacy Task objects to ECS task components
- Handle task type mapping and data transformation
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition

### 03. TaskQueue ECS Integration (03-taskqueue-ecs-integration.md)
- Modify TaskQueue to work with ECS task components
- Implement component pooling integration
- Add support for new task dependency resolution

### 04. Main Game Loop Integration (04-main-loop-integration.md)
- Integrate TaskExecutionSystem into main game loop
- Add system initialization to game startup
- Configure proper update order with existing systems

### 05. Legacy System Phase-Out (05-legacy-system-phaseout.md)
- Gradually replace legacy Task.lua usage with ECS components
- Remove obsolete code paths and cleanup
- Update entity creation to use new task components

### 06. Migration Testing and Validation (06-migration-testing.md)
- Create comprehensive tests for migration process
- Validate functionality parity between old and new systems
- Performance benchmarking and optimization verification

### 07. System Dependencies Update (07-system-dependencies-update.md)
- Update all systems that depend on legacy task components
- Refactor imports and references throughout codebase
- Ensure proper initialization order

### 08. Performance Optimization and Cleanup (08-performance-optimization.md)
- Remove legacy system overhead
- Optimize component access patterns
- Implement final performance improvements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All legacy task functionality preserved in new ECS system
- [ ] Performance equal to or better than legacy implementation
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing game behavior
- [ ] Clean removal of all legacy task management code
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for migration process
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture

## Dependencies

This phase depends on completion of all Phase 1 and Phase 2 subtasks:
- Base TaskComponent architecture (Phase 1)
- All specialized task components and systems (Phase 2)

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each adapter and bridge component
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance benchmarks comparing old vs new systems
- End-to-end game functionality validation
